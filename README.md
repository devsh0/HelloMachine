## Intro
Java 21 introduced the Foreign Function and Memory API which makes interacting with native
code and libraries so much easier. With the ability to call system APIs directly from Java,
it is now possible to execute raw machine code without relying on C/C++ as an intermediary â€”
alongside many other practical use cases that are not as silly as this one.

This is a simple hello-world prototype that prints "Hello Machine!" from a function defined
in native x86-64 machine code. It works like this:

1. Map a `W|X` region of memory and copy the machine code there.* 
2. Register a signal handler with the callback pointing to the function that's present
   in the sample machine code. Make sure not to mask any signal that JVM itself would
   intercept for its own purposes. I am using SIGCONT, it looked (relatively) harmless to me.
3. Raise the signal.

\* While good enough for a prototype, having `W|X` pages in your program for an extended period
   of time violates Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and is generally considered a bad idea.

## Build and Run
* The prototype only targets x86-64 Linux.
```shell
uname -a
Linux ubuntu-amd64 6.12.5-orbstack-00287-gf8da5d508983 # ...
```
I am testing this on guest Ubuntu running on OrbStack. Host is Apple Silicon (M2) Mac.

* The code uses APIs only available in Java 23, though with some changes you can get it working
  on Java 21 as well.
```shell
java -version
openjdk version "23.0.1" 2024-10-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu23.30+13-CA (build 23.0.1+11)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu23.30+13-CA (build 23.0.1+11, mixed mode, sharing)
```

* Compile:
```shell
javac Demo.java
```

* Run:
```shell
java --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED Demo
```
